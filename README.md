# Sound Display+
A (more feature-complete) tool for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance to find IDs of sounds and work with them in-game. 

## Features
  - Toggleable sound display that shows all sounds that are and have been playing
  - Mouse control to play, stop and manage all sounds in the list
  - Keyboard shortcuts to toggle and clear the list, as well as to stop all currently playing sounds

## Default controls
Pressing L will display/hide the list of sounds.
Pressing K will clear the list, while pressing Left Control + K will stop all currently playing sounds.
Left-clicking on any of the entries in the list will play the respective sound. When holding Left Control, left-clicking will stop the sound.  Right-clicking will remove that entry from the list.

## Installation
Create a folder in /The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/ and place the main.lua file in that folder.

## Notes
The green indicates when a sound is playing. Due to a bug, some sounds will remain green even when they have stopped playing.
